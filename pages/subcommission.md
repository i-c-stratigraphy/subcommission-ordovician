The subcommission is chaired by Prof. David Harper, a leading expert on major events in the history of life and numerical methods in palaeontology together with fossil brachiopods. He is Professor of Palaeontology in the Department of Earth Sciences, Principal of Van Mildert College and Deputy Head of Colleges (Research). He was previously Professor of Palaeontology and Head of Geology in the Natural History Museum of Denmark, University of Copenhagen. He is a Foreign Member of the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters, and an Einstein Professor in the Chinese Academy of Sciences. He has published over 10 books and monographs, including a couple of influential textbooks, as well as over 250 scientific articles and, together with Øyvind Hammer, the widely-used software package PAST. His research is mainly field-based and he has led expeditions to many parts of the world including central Australia, Chile, Greenland and Tibet.

**Ian G. PERCIVAL**  
Principal Research Scientist (Palaeontologist)  
Geological Survey of NSW, W.B. Clarke Geoscience Centre  
947-953 Londonderry Rd, Londonderry 2753

Tel: 61-2-4777-0315  
E-mail: <ian.percival@industry.nsw.gov.au>  

Dr Ian Percival is the Senior Principal Research Scientist (Palaeontologist) in the Geological Survey of New South Wales, based in outer Sydney. The current primary emphasis of his work involves refining the Ordovician biostratigraphic framework across NSW, to support the regional mapping program of the Geological Survey. He has published widely on Early Palaeozoic brachiopods of Australia and New Zealand, concentrating on those in the Ordovician, with a focus on trimerellide and lingulate brachiopods. A second major area of research interest concerns conodonts (again mainly of Ordovician age), where he has been involved in study of faunas preserved in cherts as well as those more conventionally extracted from limestones. He has also dabbled in Ordovician molluscs (especially nautiloids).

Dr Percival has been Secretary of the Subcommission on Ordovician Stratigraphy since 2008, and edits the annual newsletter *Ordovician News*. He also is editor of the Association of Australasian Palaeontologists’ annual newsletter *Nomen Nudum*.
